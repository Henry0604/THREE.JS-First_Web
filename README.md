# THREE.JS-First_Web
This project aims to provide an initial glimpse of the potential that THREE.js can offer in the development of 3D graphics on the Web.

## Introduction
Here, the development of a cube was proposed, which will receive light to generate a shadow that will be reflected on a plane. It also has an orbit, so you can zoom in and move the plane.
